# Project Title

Wake On LAN with Raspberry Pi

## Deprecated
This repository is deprecated.
Instead of using Wake-on-LAN function to wake PCs, I am using PCIe Wifi Remote Control On/Off switch for my PCs. 
There're plenty of brands out there support it with a relatively cheap cost (Tuya / eWeLink) and is able to directly integrate with IoT Platforms like Home Assitant / Alexa.

## Objective
As it is pretty hard to find a way to Wake on LAN to my devices within home network, I decided to build one myself.

This project allow users wake their PC with a hit of a button on any web browsers and uses minimal electricity.

With this, users can now put their computer to sleep and wake it up to remote in or access media / file server anytime.


## Getting Started
This guide will not cover installation of OS & packages, hardening of OS, and Networking.

As I am running my Raspberry Pi Zero W on Raspbian, hence there will be minimal security enabled.
Please harden the OS before publishing it to production as it is extremely vulnerable to any sorts of attack.

User are able to access from anywhere with Internet available,
To wake **devices within same Local Area Network (LAN) of Raspberry Pi** due to the limitation of Wake on LAN.

### Prerequisites
This Project uses: 
* Raspberry Pi Zero W : As it is cheap & low power consumption
* PHP 7
* Laravel v5.3.31 
* Mysql 
* Etherwake : For Wake On LAN
* Apache2
